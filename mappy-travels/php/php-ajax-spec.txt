1) php files should begin with the following 3 lines of code:

session_start();                                - to ensure the $_SESSION variable is available and persisted
require ('dbconnect.php');                      - to get access to a $conn variable, which holds the mysqli object.
header('Content-Type: application/json');       - to ensure that responses will be a JavaScript object

2) because a valid JSON response is one JSON object, you should echo only one object - usually an associative array with
everything you need inside it

eg.

$username = "Rob"
$friendList = Array("Bob", "Lob");
echo json_encode(Array( "username" => $username, "id" => 6, "friends"=> $friendList  ));

- your front end response will be a json object that looks like this:
{
    username: "Rob",
    id: 6,
    friends: ["Bob", "Lob"]
}



3) because we rely on the session variable to keep users logged in, all files that get or post an individual users data
should contain the following code:

if (!isset($_SESSION['username'])){
    echo json_encode(Array("session_timeout"=>true));
    die("");
}
//if you're still here, you're still logged in


- all code handling the ajax response should check for session timeout and redirect to login, eg

if (response.session_timeout){
    loadTemplate('login');
}
else {
    //you've got data for this page
}


4) it's good practice to call $conn->close() at the end of every script
